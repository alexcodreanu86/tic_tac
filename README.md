# Tic Tac Toe with min max algorithm

To be able to see the coverage of the tests please start a server. A simple comand to start a server that I use is `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. The tests can be viewed at [http://localhost:8000/SpecRunner.html](http://localhost:8000/SpecRunner.html). 
To Play the game you can either go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) or open the `index.html` file. 

The tests coverage will not work properly if run only by opening `SpecRunner.html`(even though the tests still work).
